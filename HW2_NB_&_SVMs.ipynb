It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.\n","\n","## Dataset Attribute Information\n","\n","1. **date**: Date in MM-DD-YYYY\n","2. **day**: Day of the Week\n","3. **quarter** : A portion of the month.
